## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

The goal is simple: be the last snake slithering.

### Controls
*   **Player 1 (Teal):** Use the **WASD** keys to move.
*   **Player 2 (Magenta):** Use the **Arrow Keys** to move.

### Rules
1.  **Eat to Grow:** Collect the white food squares to grow your snake's length.
2.  **Avoid Collisions:** The game ends for you if you crash into:
    *   The outer walls.
    *   Your own tail.
    *   Your opponent's snake.
3.  **Head-on-Head:** If both players collide head-on, the match is a **Draw**.
4.  **Last One Standing Wins:** Outmaneuver your opponent to be the sole survivor!
